Getting Around Town</B> 
Bus or subway costs <B>US$1.50 </B>per person. If you are traveling in a group of three or
four people, Yellow Medallion Taxis are the most convenient way to get around the 
city. Tipping the driver for good service at the rate of 15 percent is customary in 
New York. 
   The bus and subway system is generally safe within Manhattan during daylight and 
early evening hours, but always practice common-sense safety. Carry important 
documents in a money belt or leave them in the hotel safe. Be sure you know the 
reputation of the area where you are going. Strolling through certain sections after 
dark with a tourist map could be asking for trouble.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <B>
Foreign Currency Exchange</B> 
Currency can be exchanged at most banks, at some travel agencies, and at specialized 
currency exchange outlets. Some charge a flat fee of US$5 or so in addition to their 
outrageous exchange rates, which can vary from place to place. Usually the most 
economical way to obtain US currency is through any bank machine that accepts your 
foreign bank card via networks such as Cirrus, NYCE, or Plus. Though your foreign 
bank may also charge a fee for using your card abroad, the currency exchange rates 
on such transactions typically can't be beat. Failing that, call or visit one of 
the following places:  <B>
&nbsp;
Chase Manhattan Bank </B>at 8th Ave. &amp; 57th Street, no fee and best rate, (212)935-9935, <B>

<H3><CENTER>Gary's Walking Tour of Midtown (or Where Am I?)
</CENTER></H3>

<PRE>&nbsp;
In most of Manhattan, north-south roads are called Avenues and east-west roads are 
called Streets. The distance from one Avenue to the next is 2 to 3 times as long as 
the distance from one Street to the next. The hotel is located at 57th Street between 
9th and 10th Avenues.  You are in midtown. If you stand at the front entrance of the 
hotel, you are looking NORTH. 9TH AVENUE is to your RIGHT and 10TH AVENUE is to your 
LEFT.  Street numbers increase going north. Avenue numbers increase going west. Some 
Avenues have names instead of numbers.  
&nbsp;
CENTRAL PARK, is a beautiful place to walk. It is just a few blocks away.  An entrance 
is on 59th St. and 8th Ave., that is, two blocks north and 1 and 1/2 blocks east.  This 
area is called Columbus Circle. Central Park stretches north all the way to 110th St. 
and east to 5th Ave.  There are several museums on the east side (5th Ave) of the Park, 
including the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART at 81st St. and the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM at 89th 
St. On the west side (8th Ave., called here, Central Park West) is the AMERICAN MUSEUM 
OF NATURAL HISTORY at 77th St.  LINCOLN CENTER, home of symphony concerts and operas is 
also on the west side at 9th Ave. and 63rd St. 
 
&nbsp;
South and east of the hotel is TIMES SQUARE at approximately 43rd St. and 7th Ave. This
area contains an unbelievable array of electronic billboards and theaters.  If you have 
ever heard of the lights of Broadway, this is what they are talking about. Approach 
Times Square by walking east on 57th St. past 8th Ave. to BROADWAY which crosses 
diagonally.  Then walk south on Broadway.  Or, continue on 57th St. to 7th Ave. to see 
CARNEGIE HALL at the corner and then walk south on 7th Ave.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Further east, on 5th Ave. between 49th and 50th Streets is ROCKEFELLER CENTER.  Here is 
the famous golden statue of Prometheus, an ice rink (operating until April), Radio City 
Music Hall and the studios of the NBC morning program TODAY.  Just a few blocks away is 
the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART (MOMA) at 53rd St. between 5th and 6th Avenues.  A few blocks 
south and east at 43rd and Park Ave. (two blocks east past 5th) is the classic style 
train station, GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL.  It has been undergoing renovation for the last 
two years, but is looking beautiful inside.  LOOK UP!  If you go to Grand Central, you 
will get a good look at the building on the RECOMB POSTER, the CHRYSLER BUILDING (and 
you thought it was the Empire State Building)! A good view is at about 44th St. and 
Madison Ave, one block east of 5th. Look east down 44th St. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
For other interesting excursions, go to GREENWICH VILLAGE and the EAST VILLAGE, starting
south of 14th St. and stretching from one side of Manhattan to the other.  WASHINGTON 
SQUARE PARK and NYU are in Greenwich Village at about 5th Ave. and 5th St. SOHO, (South 
of Houston St.), is a few block further south, walk down Broadway. Note that the 
north-south east-west orientation of streets breaks down hear so it is easy to get lost.
The BROOKLYN BRIDGE is beautiful and should not be missed.  You can walk across it to 
get a view of Manhattan.  Take the subway there and get off at City Hall (N and R lines)
or Brooklyn Bridge City Hall (6 line).</PRE>
